# 🗺 Land Administration & Visualization Dashboard (Prototype)

This dashboard is a **web-based spatial decision-support system** developed as a **prototype** to demonstrate how land parcels, zoning, ownership, and suitability analysis can be visualized and queried interactively.

The system is designed to support **land administration, planning, and land-use decision-making**, with extensibility for advanced analytics and institutional deployment.

---

## ⚠ Prototype Disclaimer

This dashboard is a **proof-of-concept prototype**, built to demonstrate core ideas and workflows.

It is **not a final production system**.  
Advanced functionalities, performance optimizations, and institutional customizations can be implemented based on stakeholder requirements.

---

## 🎯 Core Dashboard Objectives

- Visualize **base maps and land-use layers**
- Enable **interactive parcel search and querying**
- Support **land availability and ownership checks**
- Demonstrate **land suitability and zoning logic**
- Provide a foundation for **future building-level and distance-based analysis**

---

## 🧩 Key Dashboard Features

### 1. Base Map & Layer Controls
- Users can toggle multiple **base surface layers** using checkboxes
- Enables comparison between:
  - Base imagery
  - Thematic land-use layers
  - Environmental or zoning overlays
- Supports visual analysis of how land-use layers overlap spatially

---

### 2. Land Use & Zoning Visualization
The dashboard categorizes land into functional zones, including:
- Residential land
- Commercial land
- Institutional land
- Reserved land
- Green/open spaces

This helps users understand **what type of activity is suitable** for each parcel.

---

### 3. Land Availability & Suitability Assessment
- Identifies land parcels that are:
  - Vacant
  - Occupied
  - Reserved
- Supports decision-making for:
  - Development
  - Institutional use
  - Commercial purposes
- Green components indicate environmentally suitable or undeveloped areas

---

### 4. Parcel Search by Block & Plot Number
Users can search for land parcels using:
- **Block number**
- **Plot number**

#### Example Workflow:
1. User enters *Block 4, Plot 2*
2. System automatically locates the parcel
3. Parcel is highlighted on the map (e.g., yellow)
4. Associated land information is retrieved

This enables fast identification without manual map navigation.

---

### 5. Parcel Ownership & Registration Details
Once a parcel is selected, the dashboard displays:
- Ownership status (available or registered)
- Owner’s name (if registered)
- Date of land registration
- Land use type
- Additional parcel metadata

This supports **basic land verification and transparency**.

---

### 6. Filtering & Visualization by Plot Status
Users can:
- Filter plots by availability
- Display only vacant plots
- Display only registered plots
- View plots grouped by blocks

This improves clarity when working with large land layouts.

---

### 7. Plot-Level Inspection & Insights
Each plot can be inspected individually to:
- Confirm availability
- Review ownership details
- Examine suitability for intended use

This is especially useful for:
- Prospective buyers
- Planners
- Land administrators

---

### 8. Extensible Spatial Analysis (Planned)
The system is designed to support future enhancements such as:
- Distance-based analysis (e.g., proximity to roads, buildings, utilities)
- Building footprint visualization
- Image-based building inspection
- Configurable spatial rules based on user-defined requirements

These features can be activated or expanded depending on institutional needs.

---

## 🏗 System Design Philosophy

- **Modular**: Each feature can be upgraded independently
- **Scalable**: Can evolve from prototype to full land information system
- **User-driven**: Functionalities expand based on real-world use cases
- **Policy-aligned**: Designed with land governance and planning workflows in mind

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Full cadastral database integration
- Role-based access (admin, planner, public user)
- Advanced suitability modeling
- 3D building visualization
- Integration with satellite and drone imagery
- Automated land compliance checks
